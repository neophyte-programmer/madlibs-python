# Madlibs With Python

Madlibs is a game created by Leonard Stern and Roger Price. The in - person version consists of one player prompting others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading aloud. however, since this is on a computer, it will be played a little different. I will give directions below
<br>
This project is to help me study the concept of string concatenation in Python and the different ways it can be implemented

## How to Play
- Run the `maingame.py` file
- You will be prompted to enter a list of words and hinted as to which type of word
- Enter the words accordingly
- At the end, a story will be generated based on your input.
- Read the paragraph and see if your story is coherent ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

NB: There a number of madlib files and the `maingame.py` file pulls out a random one for you
Have fun

String Concatenation in Python
Assuming there is a variable called name, one can concatenate the value of name to a string in three ways:
name = "Nutifafa"

1. print("my name is " + name)
2. print("my name is {}".format(name))
3. print(f"my name is {name}")

# adj = input("Adjective: ")
# verb1 = input("Verb: ")
# verb2 = input("Verb: ")
# famousPerson = input("A famous person: ")
#
# madlib = f"Computer programming is so {adj}! It makes me excited all the time because I love to {verb1}. " \
#          f"Stay hydrated and {verb2} like you are {famousPerson}!"
